POST AND DELETE METHODS HANDLE, SO FAR ONLY GET IS HANDLED

for POST:
1) check limit_except, if not allowed send 405 with allowed METHODS
2) create/modify file
3) send page "successfully_uploaded.html" with GET?


File System Hierarhy Standard for Server in docker/cmake

KEEP ALIVE TIMER!!! -> works, might've forgotten something

Stream send files to the client.

SET UP LOGS -> make run ||| Apparently, I gotta create the files when I init Log class, can create the dir in cmake tho TODO

PARSE ERROR PAGES FROM THE CONFIG!!!

handle cgi timeouts

remove exits(Failure) inside server loop, disconnect client instead
make tokenize() ignore comments

ParseRequest, potentially change to ParseConfig tokenization.

handle if index not found, autoindex off TODO as well as multiple indexes

to prevent malicious user, send error 400 in case of same headers in request

parse headers for the cgi

check if happens if the client runs CGI and instantly sends totally different request (potentially should save current request state in cgi)

store IPV4 or IPV6 in Client, also pass it to the CGI (inet_ntop  #include <arpa/inet.h>)

add extern for c libs

move cgiinfo from client to httprequest makes more sense ig

potentially dynamically allocate memore if keep_alive in CLient.cpp

CGI
1. check if request Content-Type is png and the method is POST
2. check config location for cgi rule
3. check physical address of the cgi script in the config
4. fork() + pipe() server process
5. set environment variables and run execve()
6. run open() with "xb" flags
7. for now create files in the static ./images/ dir
